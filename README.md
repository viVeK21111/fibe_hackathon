### Steps performed
1) Various preprocessing techniques like filling nan values, removing column if nan values are more than 80%, data normalization, data reduction (svd) <br>
2) performed undersampling to balancd the class distribution <br>
3) Removed features with constant values <br>
4) Data scaling <br>
5) matched colums in train and test data  <br>
6) Using randomforestclassifier and logisticregression <br>
7) And performed hyperparameter tuning to reduce overfitting <br>
8) Prediction of test data by using trained model <br>
