# fibe_hackathon
Goto notebook/fibe.ipynb for clear implementation of the model 
various preprocessing techniques like filling nan values, removing column if nan values are more than 80%, data normalization, data reduction (svd)
performed undersampling to balancd the class distribution
Removed features with constant values
data scaling
matched colums in train and test data 
using randomforestclassifier and logisticregression
And performed hyperparameter tuning to reduce overfitting
prediction of test data by using trained model
